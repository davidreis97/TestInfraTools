Goss (dgoss):
    - Fast, but more limited than the other tools.
    - Open-source
    - Compatibility and limitations: https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss#limitations
        - Linux only (may run on winndows and macos)
        - Some tests have "limitations" (unspecified).

Serverspec:
    - Lacks testing for HTTP request
    - Gives bad results on certain situations (when entrypoint fails it blames the first test from the suite)
    - Can be optimized to performance levels closer to Goss if the type of OS is specified.
    - Open-source and can be extendable for tests which are not in the library already
    - Compatibility and limitations: https://serverspec.org/tutorial.html#multi_os_support
        - https://github.com/mizzy/specinfra/tree/master/lib/specinfra/command

Inspec:
    - Open-source
    - Largest set of features
    - https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/migration/ -> Direct comparison with Serverspec
    - Compatibility and Limitations
        - https://github.com/inspec/inspec#supported-os

There may be the option of installing one of the tools in a docker container and running it from there (may affect performance).

Tests made on a nodejs server. Time since start of execution of docker build until results are printed.

WITHOUT CACHING, FROM SCRATCH (less relevant test since it depends on network conditions):

Goss: 34,315s
Serverspec: 48,279s

WITH CACHING, NO CODE CHANGES (CRASHING ON DOCKER BUILD):

Goss: 2,768s / 2,644s / 2,679s
Serverspec: 1,765s / 1,767s / 1,762s
Inspec: 2,768s / 2,644s / 2,679s (Same as goss since docker build is not handled by the tool)
